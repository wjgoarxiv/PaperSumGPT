| __Title__ | Perception of ChatGPT: An Analysis of Social Media and Scientific Publications |
| __Introduction__ | ChatGPT is a chatbot released by OpenAI that has gained over 100 million subscribers in two months. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how ChatGPT is perceived based on over 300k tweets and 150+ scientific papers. |
| __Methodology__ | The authors used NLP technology to analyze sentiment and emotion in tweets and machine translation systems to analyze tweets in languages other than English. For scientific papers, four co-authors annotated 48 Arxiv and 104 SemanticScholar papers on three dimensions: topic, impact, and quality. |
| __Experimental procedure__ | The authors annotated scientific papers using guidelines developed after low agreement in initial annotation rounds. Only paper abstracts were used for classification, and guidelines were developed for prioritizing labels in ambiguous cases. |
| __Data analysis__ | ChatGPT is generally perceived positively, with high quality and associated emotions of joy dominating. Its perception has slightly decreased since its debut, and non-English tweets tend to have more negative sentiment. ChatGPT is viewed as a great opportunity across various scientific fields, including the medical domain, but it is also seen as a threat in the education domain and from an ethical perspective. |
| __Results & discussion__ | The authors found that ChatGPT is viewed as an opportunity in most scientific fields, but also as a threat from an ethical perspective and in education. ChatGPT is mostly perceived positively on social media, with some decrease in positivity since its debut. |
| __Conclusions__ | This analysis contributes to shaping the public debate and informing the future development of ChatGPT. Future work should investigate trends over longer periods, consider popularity of tweets and papers, and investigate additional dimensions beyond sentiment and emotion. |
| __Significance of this study__ | This study provides insights into the perception of a highly popular chatbot, which can inform future development and public debate surrounding AI language models. |
| __Things to look out for in follow-up research__ | Future research should investigate the real impact of language models like ChatGPT on society, including their potential to exacerbate or mitigate existing inequalities and biases. |
