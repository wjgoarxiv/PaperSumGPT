# **Public Discourse on ChatGPT: An Analysis of Social Media and Scholarly Publications**

## **Introduction**
This paper presents an analysis of the public discourse surrounding ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI. The study analyzes social media posts and scholarly publications related to ChatGPT, with a focus on identifying the overall sentiment and emotions expressed in these sources.

## **Methodology**
The study employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment and emotions expressed in tweets related to ChatGPT, as well as scholarly publications from the ArXiv and SemanticScholar databases. The study also utilizes human annotation to categorize papers according to their quality and impact.

### **Apparatus**
The study uses a variety of NLP tools, including sentiment and emotion classifiers and machine translation systems. The researchers also develop a set of annotation categories for categorizing papers according to their quality and impact.

### **Experimental procedure**
The study collects a set of tweets related to ChatGPT using the #ChatGPT hashtag, as well as scholarly publications from the ArXiv and SemanticScholar databases. The researchers then use NLP tools to analyze the sentiment and emotions expressed in the tweets, as well as to categorize the scholarly publications according to their quality and impact.

### **Data analysis**
The study analyzes the sentiment and emotions expressed in the tweets related to ChatGPT, as well as the quality and impact of the scholarly publications. The study also categorizes the sentiment expressed in various independent resources around the web.

## **Results & discussion**
The study finds that the overall sentiment expressed in tweets related to ChatGPT is largely positive, with users expressing excitement about the model's capabilities. However, the study also identifies concerns regarding the potential negative impacts of ChatGPT, such as the exacerbation of existing inequalities and biases. The study also identifies mixed sentiment in scholarly publications related to ChatGPT, with some papers expressing concerns about the potential negative impacts of the model.

## **Conclusions**
The study concludes that the public discourse surrounding ChatGPT is largely positive, but also identifies concerns about the potential negative impacts of the model. The study emphasizes the need for further research to assess the real impact of language models like ChatGPT on society, including their potential to exacerbate existing inequalities and biases.

## **Significance of this study**
This study provides important insights into the public discourse surrounding ChatGPT, shedding light on the overall sentiment expressed in social media and scholarly publications. The study's findings can help to inform the development of language models like ChatGPT and shape the public debate surrounding these models.

## **Things to look out for in follow-up research**
Future research should investigate developments over longer stretches of time, consider popularity of tweets and papers, investigate more dimensions besides sentiment and emotion, and look at the expertise of social media actors and their geographic and demographic distribution.
