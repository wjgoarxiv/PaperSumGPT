# Perception of ChatGPT: A Comprehensive Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
- ChatGPT is a language model released by OpenAI in November 2022 and gained over 100 million subscribers in just two months.
- The study aims to investigate the perception of ChatGPT from various perspectives, including sentiment, emotion, and its impact on society.

## METHODOLOGY
- The study analyzed over 300k tweets and more than 150 scientific papers.
- Social media posts were analyzed using NLP technology like sentiment and emotion classifiers and machine translation systems.
- Annotations of the papers were based on their quality and whether they describe ChatGPT as a threat or opportunity.

## RESULTS & DISCUSSION
- ChatGPT is generally perceived positively with high quality and associated emotions of joy dominating.
- However, the perception of ChatGPT has slightly decreased since its debut, and in languages other than English, it is perceived with more negative sentiment.
- ChatGPT is viewed as a great opportunity in various scientific fields, including the medical domain. However, it is also seen as a threat from an ethical perspective and in the education domain.
- Lists of failure cases showed the poorest overall sentiment, often involving math problems where ChatGPT frequently provides confidently incorrect answers.

## CONCLUSION
- ChatGPT is a promising language model with high-quality outputs, but its limitations and potential negative social impacts should also be taken into account.
- Future research should investigate developments over longer stretches of time, consider popularity of tweets and papers, investigate more dimensions besides sentiment and emotion, and look at the expertise of social media actors and their geographic and demographic distribution.
- Future research can assess the real impact of language models like ChatGPT on society, including their potential to exacerbate and mitigate existing inequalities and biases.

## SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY
- This study contributes to shaping the public debate and informing the future development of ChatGPT.
- It highlights the strengths and limitations of the language model, its potential impact on society, and the need to address potential ethical concerns.
- The study also shows the importance of analyzing social media posts and scientific papers to understand public perception of new technologies.

## STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED:
1. Analyze social media posts and scientific papers to understand public perception of new technologies.
2. Use NLP technology like sentiment and emotion classifiers and machine translation systems to automatically analyze social media posts.
3. Consider the quality of scientific papers and whether they describe the technology as a threat or opportunity.
4. Investigate more dimensions besides sentiment and emotion and look at the expertise of social media actors and their geographic and demographic distribution.
5. Assess the real impact of new technologies on society, including their potential to exacerbate and mitigate existing inequalities and biases.
