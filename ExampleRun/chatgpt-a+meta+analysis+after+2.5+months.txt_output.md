# **Perception of ChatGPT: A Comprehensive Analysis**

## **Introduction**
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the perception of ChatGPT, a chatbot released by OpenAI in November 2022. ChatGPT has attracted over 100 million subscribers in only two months. We analyzed over 300k tweets and more than 150 scientific papers to understand how ChatGPT is viewed from different perspectives, how its perception has changed over time, and what its strengths and limitations are.

## **Methodology**
We collected tweets that contained the hashtag #ChatGPT and analyzed them using natural language processing (NLP) techniques like sentiment and emotion classifiers and machine translation systems. We also analyzed scientific papers from Arxiv and SemanticScholar. Four co-authors of this paper initially annotated 10 papers on all three dimensions independently without guidelines. After a discussion of disagreements, we devised guidelines for subsequent annotation of 10 further papers.

## **Results & Discussion**
We found that ChatGPT is generally perceived positively, with high quality, and associated emotions of joy dominating. However, its perception has slightly decreased since its debut, and in languages other than English, it is perceived with more negative sentiment. Moreover, while ChatGPT is viewed as a great opportunity across various scientific fields, including the medical domain, it is also seen as a threat from an ethical perspective and in the education domain.

## **Conclusions**
Our findings contribute to shaping the public debate and informing the future development of ChatGPT. Future work should investigate developments over longer stretches of time, consider popularity of tweets and papers, investigate more dimensions besides sentiment and emotion, and look at the expertise of social media actors and their geographic and demographic distribution.

## **Significance of this study**
This study provides insights into how the public perceives ChatGPT, a highly popular chatbot released by OpenAI. The results of this study can inform future development efforts and help mitigate potential negative social impacts.

## **Things to look out for in follow-up research**
Future research can assess the real impact of language models like ChatGPT on society, including their potential to exacerbate and mitigate existing inequalities and biases.
